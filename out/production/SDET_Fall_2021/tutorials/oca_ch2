Operators and Statements:

Operator - its  a special symbol that can be applied to a set of variables, values, or literls.
Java has 3 operators: unary, binary, ternary;
Operator precedence: (same level of pres: -> from left to right)
1. post-unary : var++, var--;
2. pre-unary: ++var, --var;
3. other unary oper: +, -, !;
4. mult/div/mod: *, /, %
5. add/sub: +, -
6. shift oper: <<, >>, >>>
7. relational oper: <, >, <=, >=, instanceOf
8. equal to/ not EqTo: ==, !=
9. logical: &, ^, |
10. short-circuit logical: &&, ||
11. ternary: boolean_exp ? expr_1 : expr_2 ;
12. assignment oper: =, +=, -=...

*** Numeric Promoion ***
1. two val have diff data types, Java autom. promotes one val to larger val;
2. one integral , another floating-point -> promote integral to floating poing data type;
//Integral types are types that have integer values. These are int, long, short, byte, and char.
3. smaller dt ( byte, short, char) first promoted to int any time they are used, even if neither of them have int type.
4. the result == operands (after promotion) data type;
#1
int x = 1;
long y = 33;
x * y -> long //first rule
#2
double x = 39.21;
float y = 2.1; // compilation error , Java treats float-point literals to double. (2.1f - works)
x + y -> double // y=2.1f;
#3
short x = 14;
float y = 13;
double z = 30;
x * y / z
1. short x -> int // first rule
2. int x -> float // second rule
3. float -> double // first rule

Logical comp:
boolean y = -true, z = !0; int x = !5;// not compile
int counter = 0;
sout(counter); // output 0
out(++counter); // output 1
out(counter); // output 1
out(counter--); // output 1
out(counter); // output 0

*** Casting primitive values ***
Casting primitives is requires:
1. it goes from larger num data to a smaller;
2. converting from a float point num to  an integral value;( These are int, long, short, byte, and char.)

*** Overflow and Underflow ***
1. Overflow is when a number is so large that it will no longer fit within the data type, so the system "wraps around"
to the next lowest value and counts up from there.
2. Underflow - when the num is too low to fin tin the data type;

*** Compound assignment operators ***
+= , -=
int x, z = 3;
x = x * z; // error , x is not assigned

*** Relational Operators ***
- return a boolean type;
>, <, >=, <=
a instanseof b

*** Logical Operators ***
- applied to the boolean and numeric data types;
- when applies to the nums they are compare bits;

& - AND
| - OR
^ - Exclusive OR

^ gives true when the operands are different;
x = true; y = true; (x ^ y) - false
x = true; y = false;(x ^ y) - true
x = false; y = true; (x ^ y) - true
x = false; y = false; (x ^ y) - false

Short circuit operators: && , || - right side of the expression may never be evaluated if the final result
can be determined by the left hand side of the expression;
Example:
int x = 6;
boolean y = (x >= 6) || (++x <= 7);
sout(x);
Output: 6 // right-side of the expression is never evaluated;

*** Equality Operators ***
== , !=  - equals, not equals;
Using:
1. Comparing two numeric primitive types. If the num values of the different data types, the val are
automatically promoted according prev.rules;
5 == 5.00 // true, because the left side promoted as a double;
2. Comparing two boolean values;
3. Comparing two objects, including null and String values;

Comparison for equality are limited only for previous 3 cases:
- boolean x = true == 3; // error
- booleat y = false != "Hello"; //error
- boolean z = 3 == "Hi"; // error
