Operators and Statements:

Operator - its  a special symbol that can be applied to a set of variables, values, or literls.
Java has 3 operators: unary, binary, ternary;
Operator precedence: (same level of pres: -> from left to right)
1. post-unary : var++, var--;
2. pre-unary: ++var, --var;
3. other unary oper: +, -, !;
4. mult/div/mod: *, /, %
5. add/sub: +, -
6. shift oper: <<, >>, >>>
7. relational oper: <, >, <=, >=, instanceOf
8. equal to/ not EqTo: ==, !=
9. logical: &, ^, |
10. short-circuit logical: &&, ||
11. ternary: boolean_exp ? expr_1 : expr_2 ;
12. assignment oper: =, +=, -=...

*** Numeric Promoion ***
1. two val have diff data types, Java autom. promotes one val to larger val;
2. one integral , another floating-point -> promote integral to floating poing data type;
//Integral types are types that have integer values. These are int, long, short, byte, and char.
3. smaller dt ( byte, short, char) first promoted to int any time they are used, even if neither of them have int type.
4. the result == operands (after promotion) data type;
#1
int x = 1;
long y = 33;
x * y -> long //first rule
#2
double x = 39.21;
float y = 2.1; // compilation error , Java treats float-point literals to double. (2.1f - works)
x + y -> double // y=2.1f;
#3
short x = 14;
float y = 13;
double z = 30;
x * y / z
1. short x -> int // first rule
2. int x -> float // second rule
3. float -> double // first rule

Logical comp:
boolean y = -true, z = !0; int x = !5;// not compile
int counter = 0;
sout(counter); // output 0
out(++counter); // output 1
out(counter); // output 1
out(counter--); // output 1
out(counter); // output 0

*** Casting primitive values ***
Casting primitives is requires:
1. it goes from larger num data to a smaller;
2. converting from a float point num to  an integral value;( These are int, long, short, byte, and char.)

*** Overflow and Underflow ***
1. Overflow is when a number is so large that it will no longer fit within the data type, so the system "wraps around"
to the next lowest value and counts up from there.
2. Underflow - when the num is too low to fin tin the data type;

*** Compound assignment operators ***
+= , -=
int x, z = 3;
x = x * z; // error , x is not assigned

*** Relational Operators ***
- return a boolean type;
>, <, >=, <=
a instanseof b

*** Logical Operators ***
- applied to the boolean and numeric data types;
- when applies to the nums they are compare bits;

& - AND
| - OR
^ - Exclusive OR

^ gives true when the operands are different;
x = true; y = true; (x ^ y) - false
x = true; y = false;(x ^ y) - true
x = false; y = true; (x ^ y) - true
x = false; y = false; (x ^ y) - false

Short circuit operators: && , || - right side of the expression may never be evaluated if the final result
can be determined by the left hand side of the expression;
Example:
int x = 6;
boolean y = (x >= 6) || (++x <= 7);
sout(x);
Output: 6 // right-side of the expression is never evaluated;

*** Equality Operators ***
== , !=  - equals, not equals;
Using:
1. Comparing two numeric primitive types. If the num values of the different data types, the val are
automatically promoted according prev.rules;
5 == 5.00 // true, because the left side promoted as a double;
2. Comparing two boolean values;
3. Comparing two objects, including null and String values;

Comparison for equality are limited only for previous 3 cases:
- boolean x = true == 3; // error
- booleat y = false != "Hello"; //error
- boolean z = 3 == "Hi"; // error

For obj comparison, the equality operator is applied to the ref. to the obj, not the obj.
The ref is equal only when they point to the same object of both point to null;

*** Java Statements ***
Control flow statements - break up the flow of execution by using decision making, looping, and branching , allowing the
app selectively execute particular segment of code.
Applied to single expression or a block of Java code. ({})

*** Ternary operator ***

booleanExpression ? expression1 : expression2;
int y = 10;
int x = (y > 5) ? (2 * y) : (3 * y);

*** Switch statement ***
Prior to Java 5.0 var could be only int or those that could be promoted to int(byte, short, char, int);
In Java 5.0 was added enums;
In Java 7.0 was added String ;
switch also supports any of the primitive numeric wrapper classes (Byte, Short, Character, Integer)
switch can contain 0 or more case branches;
break, default - are optional; but behaviour of switch would be changed;
Supports (at actual writing time) :
1. int and Integer
2. byte and Byte
3. short and Short
4. char and Character
5. String
6. enum values
// boolean and long are not supported;

*** For loop ***
Starting in Java 5.0 there are now two types for statem. (basic for loop , enhanced for loop)
1.  Initialization;
2. check boolean Expression
3. block (body ) execution
4. Execute updateStatement
5. Return to step 2

Some rules:
(1) loop components are optional : for ( ; ; ;) suot -> works

(2) Adding multiple terms to the for Statement:
    int x = 0;
    for(long y = 0, z = 4; x < 5 && y < 10; x++, y++)

(3) Re declaring a Variable in the Initialization Block:
int x = 0;
for(long y = 0, x = 4; x < 5 && y < 10; x++, y++) { // x repeated in init block after already being declared before the loop
System.out.print(x + " "); }

(4) Using Incompatible Data Types in the Init Block:
for(long y = 0, int x = 4; x < 5 && y<10; x++, y++)  { // DOES NOT COMPILE , different types in one line declared
System.out.print(x + " ");
}
(5) Using Loop Variable Outside the Loop:

for(long y = 0, x = 4; x < 5 && y < 10; x++, y++)
{ System.out.print(y + " ");
}
System.out.print(x); // DOES NOT COMPILE

*** For-each Statement ***

In Java 5.0 appeared enhanced for loop designed for iterating over arrays and Collection objects;
for (dataType instance : collection)  { // curly braces required for block of multiple st, optional for single;
    // Body
}
1) the right side must ne a build-in Java array, or an obj whose class implem. java.lang.Iterable(Java Collect frameworks);
2) left side must include a declaration for an instance of a var, whose type matches the type of a memb from right side;
// OCA exam req. : List & ArrayList;

First : check if right side is an array of Iterable - next -> check that left hand matching type;

*** Optional Labels ***
A label is an optional pointer to the head of a statement that allows the application flow to jump to it ot brear from it.
It is a sin
gle word thad is proceeded by a colon (:) .
They are used in nested loops.

*** Break statement ***
Break st - transfers the flow of control out to the enclosing statement;
Break inside the loop end the loop early .
The break st can take an optional label parameter. Without parameter the break st will terminate the nearest inner loop
it is currently in the process of execution. The optional parameter allows us to break out of a higher level outer loop.

*** The continue Statement ***
Continue ends the current iteration of the loop;
Like a break , the continue applied to the nearest inner loop under execution using optional label statements to override this behavior.

Advanced flow control usage:
1. if :  (optional labels - yes, break - no, continue - no)
2. while  :  (optional labels - yes, break - yes, continue - yes)
3. do while :  (optional labels - yes, break - yes, continue - yes)
4. for :  (optional labels - yes, break - yes, continue - yes)
5. switch :  (optional labels - yes, break - yes, continue - no)

* labels are allowed for any block statement, including those that are preceded with an if-then statement;
