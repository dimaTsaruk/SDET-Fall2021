============ Saturday 9 October ============
A software development life cycle or SDLC is essentially a project management model. It defines different stages that are necessary to bring a project from its initial idea all the way to deployment and later maintenance.

SDLC  has  different 7 stages:

1.	The first one is the planning stage -  is exactly what it sounds like: the stage in which developers will plan for the upcoming project.

2.	Analysis Stage
The analysis stage includes gathering all the specific details required for a new system .

3.	Design Stage
The design stage is a necessary pre stage to the main developer stage.
Developers will first outline the details for the overall application, alongside specific aspects, such as User interfaces, System interfaces, network requirements and Databases.

4.	Development Stage
The development stage is the part where developers actually write code and build the application according to the design documents and determined specifications.

5.	Testing Stage
After writing,  software must be tested to make sure that there are no any bugs and that the end-user will not negatively be affected at any point.

6.	Implementation and Integration Stage
After testing, the overall design for the software will come together. Different modules or designs will be integrated into the primary source code.

7.	Maintenance Stage
The SDLC doesn’t end when software reaches the market. Developers must now move into a maintenance mode and begin practicing any activities required to handle issues reported by end-users.
